## Hey, I'm Praveen Jaikant! :wave:

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Sony Pictures Entertainment. I'm based in Culver City, California.

Since 2016, I've worked in the tech industry working in a variety of backend roles. I love immersing myself in code.

I'm always trying to learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm playing the drums or checking out beaches in the LA area ðŸŒŠ

### What I'm focusing on:

Currently, MLOps is the need of the hour industry-wide. Using AWS SageMaker's SDK goes a long way in implementing most of these practices. Take a look at these [examples](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) if you're interested.
